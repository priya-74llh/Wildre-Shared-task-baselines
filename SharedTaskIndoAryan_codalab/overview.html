<H3>Shared Task on Code-mixed Less-resourced Sentiment Analysis for Indo-Aryan Languages</H3>

<p>
Code-mixing, the dynamic interplay of multiple languages within a single discourse, is a widespread linguistic phenomenon observed in multilingual societies. Code-mixing is particularly intriguing when observed in closely related languages.

We invite you to participate in our shared task at the WILDRE workshop, which is co-located with LREC-COLING 2024. This shared task addresses the complexities of code-mixed data from less-resourced similar languages for sentiment analysis. We will provide annotated data for the following code-mixed languages:

1. Magahi-Hindi-English
2. Bangla-English-Hindi
3. Hindi-English
</p>
<p>  
The evaluation will be in two different Tracks:

*A. Track 1:* Given training and validation data to determine the comment's polarity (positive, negative, neutral or mixed) in the same code-mixed setting.

1. Hindi-English
2. Magahi-Hindi-English
3. Bangla-English
4. Combined all the language pairs (1+2+3)

*B. Track 2:* Given unlabelled test data for the code-mixed Maithili language (Maithi-Hindi-English), leverage any or all of the available training datasets in Track 1 to determine the sentiment of a comment in the target language.
