<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<p>
	Classification systemâ€™s performance will be measured in terms of weighted averaged Precision, weighted averaged Recall and weighted averaged F-Score across all the classes. Weighted averaged are averaging the support-weighted mean per label. Participants are encouraged to check their system with Sklearn classification report https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html
